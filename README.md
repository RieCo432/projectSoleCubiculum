<h2>Project Sole Cubiculum</h2>
<h4>Introduction<h4>
<p>Project Sole Cubiculum (sun in the room) is a project where I equip my living room with addressable RGB strips. Every edge is
fitted with a WS2801 strip, except for the floor edges. They are all connected into one long continuous strip,
controlled by a raspberry pi in one corner of the room.
The point of this github repository is to store code used to control the LED strips.</p>
